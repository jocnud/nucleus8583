= Benchmarking =

For benchmarking, we use standard desktop PC with specifications:
 # Hardware
   * Processor            : Intel Dual Core 2.6GHz 32-bit
   * Memory               : 2 GB
   * Hard disk            : 80 GB
 # Software
   * Operating System     : Ubuntu 8.1
   * Java Virtual Machine : Sun Java VM 1.6.10 (32-bit)

In our small testing program which you can download [BenchmarkingCode here], we do `N` `write`/`pack` operations and `read`/`unpack` operations and measure its average performance, average CPU, and average memory usage. In this benchmark we use jPOS 1.7.1 as our comparison.

== Test Case ==
We use following data for our benchmarking process:
{{{
'0200423800080A010000133125         01041324310000011324310104C010000001762745214  0003701000abcdefghijkl                    '
}}}

or if we want to breakdown into details:
|| *iso bit number* || *value* ||
|| `0` || `'0200'` ||
|| `1` || `'423800080A01000013'` ||
|| `2` || `'3125         '` ||
|| `7` || `'0104132431'` ||
|| `11` || `'000001'` ||
|| `12` || `'132431'` ||
|| `13` || `'0104'` ||
|| `29` || `'C01000000'` ||
|| `37` || `'1762745214  '` ||
|| `39` || `'00'` ||
|| `48` || `'01000abcdefghijkl                    '` ||
